# TODO: Production-Ready Enhancements

This document outlines improvements to make the connection pool more robust and production-ready.

## 🔧 Core Reliability

### Connection Management
- [ ] **Connection TTL (Time-to-Live)**: Automatically close connections after a maximum age to prevent stale connections
- [ ] **Idle Connection Cleanup**: Background thread to remove connections idle beyond a threshold
- [ ] **Connection Validation**: Implement proper health checks (e.g., send ping/pong) instead of just socket error checking
- [ ] **Graceful Shutdown**: Properly close all connections when pool is destroyed
- [ ] **Connection Limits per Host**: Support different pools for different endpoints

### Error Handling & Resilience
- [ ] **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed connections
- [ ] **Circuit Breaker**: Stop attempting connections to failing hosts temporarily
- [ ] **Connection Failure Tracking**: Track and report connection failure rates
- [ ] **Pool Exhaustion Handling**: Better strategies when pool is full (queue requests, fail fast options)
- [ ] **Exception Categorization**: Distinguish between retryable and non-retryable errors

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics & Statistics
- [ ] **Detailed Metrics**: Connection creation/destruction rates, pool utilization, request latency
- [ ] **Health Monitoring**: Pool health dashboard with connection states
- [ ] **Request Tracing**: Track request lifecycle through the pool
- [ ] **Performance Profiling**: Identify bottlenecks in connection management

### Logging
- [ ] **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with correlation IDs
- [ ] **Log Levels**: Configurable verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- [ ] **Connection Lifecycle Events**: Log creation, reuse, timeout, closure events
- [ ] **Performance Logging**: Track slow connections and timeouts

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### Concurrency Improvements
- [ ] **Lock-Free Data Structures**: Use `queue.LifoQueue` or lock-free alternatives where possible
- [ ] **Connection Pooling per Thread**: Thread-local pools to reduce contention
- [ ] **Async/Await Support**: Add asyncio-compatible version using `asyncio.Queue`
- [ ] **Batch Operations**: Support for connection warm-up and batch request processing

### Resource Management
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Connection object pooling to reduce GC pressure
- [ ] **CPU Optimization**: Profile and optimize hot paths
- [ ] **Network Optimization**: TCP_NODELAY, SO_KEEPALIVE socket options
- [ ] **DNS Caching**: Cache DNS lookups to avoid repeated resolution

## 🛡️ Security & Configuration

### Security Features
- [ ] **TLS/SSL Support**: HTTPS connection pooling with certificate validation
- [ ] **Authentication**: Support for various auth methods (Basic, Bearer, mTLS)
- [ ] **Connection Encryption**: Ensure all connections use appropriate encryption
- [ ] **Access Control**: Limit which code can access pool connections

### Configuration Management
- [ ] **Configuration Files**: YAML/JSON config with environment overrides
- [ ] **Dynamic Configuration**: Hot-reload configuration without restart
- [ ] **Environment-Specific Settings**: Dev/staging/prod configuration profiles
- [ ] **Validation**: Schema validation for all configuration parameters

## 🔌 Protocol & Integration

### Protocol Support
- [ ] **HTTP/2 Support**: Multiplexing multiple requests over single connection
- [ ] **WebSocket Support**: Persistent WebSocket connection pooling
- [ ] **Custom Protocols**: Pluggable protocol handlers
- [ ] **Proxy Support**: HTTP/SOCKS proxy configuration

### Framework Integration
- [ ] **Context Manager**: `with pool.connection() as conn:` pattern
- [ ] **Decorator Pattern**: `@with_connection` decorator for automatic connection management
- [ ] **Dependency Injection**: Integration with DI frameworks
- [ ] **Request/Response Abstraction**: Higher-level HTTP client interface

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test suite with mocking
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Real network testing with test servers
- [ ] **Load Testing**: Stress testing under high concurrency
- [ ] **Chaos Engineering**: Fault injection testing (network failures, slow responses)

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Type Hints**: Full type annotation coverage
- [ ] **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation with examples
- [ ] **Code Coverage**: Maintain >90% test coverage
- [ ] **Static Analysis**: Integrate pylint, mypy, black formatting

## 🎯 Advanced Features

### Connection Strategies
- [ ] **Load Balancing**: Round-robin, least-connections, weighted strategies
- [ ] **Failover**: Automatic failover to backup servers
- [ ] **Geographic Routing**: Route to nearest/fastest endpoint
- [ ] **Connection Affinity**: Session/user-based connection pinning

### Advanced Pool Management
- [ ] **Multiple Pool Types**: Different pools for different service tiers
- [ ] **Dynamic Pool Sizing**: Auto-scale pool size based on demand
- [ ] **Connection Warming**: Pre-establish connections during startup
- [ ] **Pool Federation**: Coordinate between multiple pool instances

## 📈 Production Deployment

### Operational Concerns
- [ ] **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment with proper resource limits
- [ ] **Kubernetes Integration**: Service discovery and configuration management
- [ ] **Memory Profiling**: Detect and prevent memory leaks
- [ ] **Resource Limits**: Enforce system resource boundaries

### Monitoring Integration
- [ ] **Prometheus Metrics**: Export metrics in Prometheus format
- [ ] **Grafana Dashboards**: Pre-built monitoring dashboards
- [ ] **Alerting Rules**: Alert on pool exhaustion, high error rates
- [ ] **Health Check Endpoints**: HTTP endpoints for load balancer health checks
